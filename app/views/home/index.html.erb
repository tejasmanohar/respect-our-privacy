		<p>Did you know that your privacy rights are currently under threat? ICANN* – the overseers of the Internet’s domain name system – are considering introducing a rule that would impact all netizens. If you care about your online privacy, this is a big deal.</p>

Regarding the proposed rules governing companies that provide WHOIS privacy services (as set forth in the Privacy and Policy Services Accreditation Issues Policy document):

I urge you to respect internet users' rights to privacy and due process. 
- Everyone deserves the right to privacy.
- No one’s personal information should be revealed without a court order, regardless of whether the request comes from a private individual or law enforcement agency. 

Private information should be kept private. Thank you.</textarea>

			<h4>What's Happening</h4>
			<p>Under new guidelines proposed by MarkMonitor and others who represent the same industries that backed SOPA, domain holders with sites associated to "commercial activity" will no longer be able to protect their private information with WHOIS protection services. "Commercial activity" casts a wide net, which means that a vast number of domain holders will be affected. Your privacy provider could be forced to publish your contact data in WHOIS or even give it out to anyone who complains about your website, without due process. Why should a small business owner have to publicize her home address just to have a website?</p>
			<p>We think your privacy should be protected, regardless of whether your website is personal or commercial, and your confidential info should not be revealed without due process. If you agree, it’s time to tell ICANN.</p>
			<p>To view the new proposed rules, visit: <a href="http://gnso.icann.org/en/issues/raa/ppsai-initial-05may15-en.pdf" target="_blank">Privacy & Proxy Services Accreditation Issues Policy</a>.</p>

				<p>"No WHOIS privacy provider wants their service to be used to conceal illegal activity, and the vast majority of domain owners are not criminals. Using a WHOIS privacy service is no more suspicious than having an unlisted phone number. These new proposed rules would wreak havoc on our right to privacy online. ICANN is moving quickly, so we should too – contact them today and tell them to respect our privacy."</p>
